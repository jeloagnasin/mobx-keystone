# Property Transforms

## Overview

While model props themselves can only be JSON serializable values and models, sometimes it is useful to represent those properties in another way.
For example, a date might be represented in the backend as a string or a number timestamp, but you might actually prefer to work with date objects.
In order to address this you can use a property transform.

For example, to transform from a number timestamp into a `Date` object you can start by defining a property transform:

```ts
const asDate = propTransform({
  fromPropToData(prop: number) {
    return new Date(prop)
  },
  fromDataToProp(data: Date) {
    return +data
  },
})
```

Which can be later used to decorate your models:

```ts
@model("myApp/MyModel")
class MyModel extends Model({
  // the original property is a number
  timestamp: prop<number>(),
}) {
  // but we will transform it into Date objects
  @asDate("timestamp")
  date!: Date // remember to use ! when using Typescript!
}
```

And then used like this:

```ts
// the value will be computed and change automatically
// if the backed property changes
const date: Date = myModel.date

// setting is just as easy
// inside a model action
myModel.date = new Date()
```

Remember that for transforms to be valid this must hold:

```
given PV prop value
if fromPropToData(PV) is DV
then fromDataToProp(DV) must be PV

and inversely

given DV data value
if fromDataToProp(DV) is PV
then fromPropToData(PV) must be DV
```

## `stringAsDate` and `timestampAsDate`

Since date manipulation is very common, these built-in property transforms are already provided.
`stringAsDate` transfrom from an ISO date string to a `Date` object, while `timestampAsDate` transforms from a number timestamp to a `Date` object.
